I want to design a UC Berkeley's baseball-style cap.

### AI Assistant

Great choice! Designing a UC Berkeley baseball-style cap offers lots of opportunities to showcase school spirit with a stylish and functional accessory.

To start refining the appearance, could you share a bit more about the intended use and audience? For example:
- Is this cap for general fans, athletes, or a specific group (students, alumni, staff)?
- Will it be worn mostly outdoors (sun protection) or as a fashion statement?
- Do you want a classic, vintage, modern, or sporty look?

Also, some key appearance aspects to consider:
- Form factor: structured or unstructured crown? Flat brim or curved?
- Materials: cotton twill, mesh, wool, or a blend?
- Colors: traditional UC Berkeley blue and gold, or additional accent colors?
- Logo placement and style: embroidered “Cal” script, block “Berkeley,” mascot, or other?
- Any extra design elements: contrast stitching, patches, or special lining?

What are your initial thoughts on these points?

No worries! I’ll put together a stylish and classic UC Berkeley baseball cap design concept that balances tradition and comfort.

Here’s a proposal:

**Form Factor:**  
- Structured crown for a clean, defined shape  
- Slightly curved brim for a timeless look and sun protection  

**Materials:**  
- High-quality cotton twill for durability and breathable comfort  
- Soft inner sweatband for moisture absorption  

**Colors:**  
- Deep navy blue crown as the primary color (reflecting UC Berkeley blue)  
- Gold under-brim for a subtle pop of school spirit  

**Logo and Design Elements:**  
- Embroidered “Cal” script logo in gold centered on the front panel  
- Small embroidered “Berkeley” text on the back above the adjustable strap in gold  
- Contrast gold stitching along the brim edge to tie the design together  

**Additional Features:**  
- Adjustable strap with a metal buckle for a secure, customizable fit  
- Minimalist inside label with the UC Berkeley seal for a premium touch  

Does this concept resonate with you? Would you like to tweak any aspect of the colors, materials, or logo placement?

Looks perfect!

Fantastic! I’m glad you like the concept. If you want to adjust any details later or add features like interior lining patterns or special textures, just let me know.

When you feel the appearance design is fully refined, you can type “Appearance design completed.” Otherwise, feel free to ask about any other visual or physical elements!
