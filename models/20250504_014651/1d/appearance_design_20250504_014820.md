Design a lamp.

### AI Assistant

Great! Let's start designing your lamp's appearance. To tailor the design effectively, could you please share:

1. What type of lamp is it? (e.g., desk lamp, floor lamp, bedside lamp)
2. Where do you envision it being used? (e.g., office, living room, bedroom)
3. Do you have a preferred style? (e.g., modern, industrial, minimalist, classic)
4. Any preferences on size or shape? (e.g., tall and slender, short and wide, geometric)
5. What materials do you like? (e.g., metal, wood, glass, fabric)
6. Do you want any specific colors or finishes?
7. Would you like any particular user interface elements? (e.g., touch controls, dimmer switches)
8. Any ergonomic considerations, like adjustability or portability?

With these details, I can help you refine the lampâ€™s form, materials, colors, and interaction design.
