## Design Philosophy and Aesthetics

Rooted deeply in the Art Deco tradition, the lamp’s design celebrates bold geometry, rich materiality, and sculptural form. The spiral stand is both an artistic expression and a structural element, while the faceted brass finish plays with light and shadow to evoke a sense of movement and opulence. The midnight blue glass shade adds a modern twist with its soft glow and elegant color contrast against the warm brass and crisp white marble.

Ergonomics and usability are carefully integrated: the rotary dimmer’s discreet placement ensures intuitive control, and the lamp’s proportions and light quality are optimized for intimate, close-range use. This synthesis of form and function exemplifies the revival of design heritage through a contemporary lens.
